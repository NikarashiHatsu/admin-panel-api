## About Admin Panel API
This project is used for private project which need an Admin Dashboard. I make this to provide their API needs. Made with Laravel Passport which support fully OAuth2 implementation, the whole idea of building this is just perfection.

## How to Install
1. Clone this repository.
2. Go to the project's directory and run `composer install` to install all dependencies Laravel needs to use.
3. Go to the repository and do `php artisan passport:install` to install Laravel Passport.
4. The API documentation is on the way, but you can see the progress [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/9584289/T17Ge7Nf?version=latest).
5. More documentation on how to install will be informed later on.

### Notes
- This application is far beyond perfect, since it's the first time for me to use OAuth2 implementation. So expect bugs and errors. Please give me a report if you find some.
